<?php
include "./include/header.php";
?>

<h1>Product page</h1>

<?php
include "./include/footer.php";

<!-- 

key differences between include and require 
is like the difference between vite and react app

include with html files
require with php files because it stops the page with an error 

include_once   require once
they check if the file was recalled before if yes it is not gonna be recalled again
