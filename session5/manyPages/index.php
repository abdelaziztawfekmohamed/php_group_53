<!-- 

key differences between include and require 
is like the difference between vite and react app

include with html css js files
require with php files because it stops the page with an error

include_once   require once
they check if the file was recalled before if yes it is not gonna be recalled again

include && require_once is used frequently 

define ('name', 'zizo'); //used for const variables
and when recalled we don't use $
